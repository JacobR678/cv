For lines 53-68 I was supposed to make a nested table (table within a table) in
order to have the two column look
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td>Web Development</td>
          <td>ğŸŒŸğŸŒŸ</td>
          <td>Guitar</td>
            <td>ğŸŒŸğŸŒŸğŸŒŸ</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Software Engineering</td>
          <td>ğŸŒŸ</td>
          <td>Anime</td>
          <td>ğŸŒŸğŸŒŸğŸŒŸğŸŒŸğŸŒŸ</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
